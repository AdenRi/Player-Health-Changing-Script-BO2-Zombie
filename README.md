# Player-Health-Changing-Script-BO2-Zombie
This gsc script change health of the player in BO2 Zombie to value closer to those of BO3 health value.

!!!Installation Tutorial!!!

To install it you need to take the compiled version (or compile the uncompiled version yourself) and drop it into your script folder you can open it by pressing WIN + R and pasting this %localappdata%\Plutonium\storage\t6 and clicking "OK" then open the "scripts" folder and then the "zm" folder (if not present create them yourself).


It's by default set to 150hp instead of the vanilla 100hp.

To change the health value you need to edit this line "self.maxhealth=150;" in the uncompiled file, for example 250hp would give you "self.maxhealth=250;" 250hp is equivalent to the health that jugger-nog give you.

Zombies deal 60 damage, so 150hp = 3 hits and 250hp = 4 to 5 hits.

You can set the value you want, but it won't change the health Jugger-nog give you will need another script for that and i don't know how to increase health of Jugger-nog.


**Fixed : in solo when getting revived by quick revive your health now comes back to 150 :')**
